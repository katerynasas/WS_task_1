In this notebook 3 classification models were built around a publicly available simple MNIST dataset:
1) Random Forest;
2) Feed-Forward Neural Network;
3) Convolutional Neural Network;
Each model is a separate class that implements MnistClassifierInterface with 2 abstract methods - train and predict. Each of models is hidden under another MnistClassifier class.
